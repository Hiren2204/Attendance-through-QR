# :bookmark_tabs: Attendance through QR
  
## :thinking: Problem Statement:

"Attendance through QR" manages and keeps track of students
attendance. This management system consists of a website and an
application. The website generates the QR code, which is scanned by the
app to record the student attendance. The teachers will receive unique
login information that may be used to create the QR code as well as to
monitor and review student attendance. Teachers can utilize the website
to view specific student information and attendance records. The website
displays a pie chart with student attendance data for the teachers and
Faculty. If a particular student's attendance rate falls below 75%, the
application will send out an alert message.
